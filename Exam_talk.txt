Whenever exam starts divide the time to each question according to their marks.

Write it somewhere that how much time you have to give to each question.

First do all those question which you know you can do and try to save time here.

Now, if you are at the end of doing any question and its time end then try to finish it as fast as you could.

Then if you have only hint of doing the question write hint very briefly anywhere and comeback later if time remains.

Give 1-2 minutes to every question to read it properly, even if you are not getting any hints on how to do it.
